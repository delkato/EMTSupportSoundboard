Notifications work like this.

NotificationHandler has queue of notifications given.
This needs to be given notifications from sensors that evaluate the patient health for bad signs (probably use timers to recheck)
The sensor is currently not implemented, but takes place of midterm JSON stream.

Notificationhandler receives those notifications, then calls handle
Handle checks, if not already busy, to play the next notification if it meets requirements.

Requirements are: PatientID exists in in patientList HashMap
		vital of notification is focused, no vitals are focused at all, OR it is priority 3

After those requirements, it calls play(notification) which returns a double
That double calls a timer, which schedule a new handle task after the double from play has expired
play should return the time of the sound clip or clips.




Play should use logic to determine what type of sound plays for the notification.
 



Things to do :

-fill out play() to do logic and play sounds (notificationHandler)
-create Sensor class to create notifications based on the patients. This can use some patient calls to determine state.
- link buttons to changing state of patients and Focuses.
